			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.
                        In this instance we worked with mathematical functions and numbers.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems we ran into with this lab was when
                        it came to actually viewing the information in the console
                        on our website. We continuously got errors telling us that
                        the variable "result" was already declared. We ran into this
                        issue while following the lab examples and screenshots. We
                        were able to fix this by simply changing the wording of the
                        second call to the results. And it all worked out as shown in
                        the assignment example after doing so.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We are happy with how this lab turned out. We feel that we took
                        a fair bit of time experimenting with JavaScript and the console itself.
                        We did look into Task X, but found it didn't really provide enough
                        information to complete. Other information we found online contradicted
                        the Task X instructions. Making it hard to complete. However we now know
                        a little bit of what we can look forward to learning in class next week.</p>
