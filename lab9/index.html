					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with
                        jQuery. The goal of the lab was to include a button
                        under each section of the lab that would change the look
                        of the section to a special CSS included in the lab.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the major problems we ran into with this lab was
                        actually getting the buttons to appear on our page. The lab
                        states that we needed to have jQuery loaded for it to work, however
                        nothing would show up even after following lab instructions. Thats
                        when we realized there was no way the Javascript could "pull" anything
                        just from the header titles in our HTML file to append a working button.
                        We found out that we needed to actually add a ID to the div of each section
                        if we wanted to actually tie a button to it back in the Javascript file.</p>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We are happy with how this lab went despite the frustration
                        we faced when it came to getting jQuery to work. We just wished
                        the instructions were a little more clear on how to link the
                        JavaScript commands to the items in our HTML code.</p>
