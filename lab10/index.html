			<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<div id="challenge" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulation. With the main goal of this
                        lab being to create a button that, when clicked, generated random "conversation". In this case
                        We used a little bit of the "Lorem Ipsum" paragraph to generate the random conversation.</p>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems we ran into with this lab was getting the button to actually
                        work when clicked. In the beginning, we fund that when clicking it, nothing happened.
                        Thats when we found out that we hadn't actually put our event lister callback and output appendage
                        INSIDE the clicker button function. In the instructions for the lab it looks like the function just ends,
                        but steps 4 and 5 actually needed to be put inside the function made in step 3.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We are ahppy with how this lab turned out. While we ran into a little hiccup with getting the button to
                        work, we managed to figure it out in the end by placing the right things inside the clicker function.
                        We were also able to do one half of Task X, we found that the user input section was a bit too complicated.
                        However, we were able to make the text generate side to side like a real text conversation. We even styled
                        the text too!</p>
