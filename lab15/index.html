			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div id="challenge" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with jQuery and Ajax. More
                        specifically we had to take an existing API and display some data stored within.
                        For this lab we decided to use the Pokemon API!</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems we ran into was being unsure of how we should display the data. The raw
                        data was easy enough to display with the given instructions from the assignment. But we wanted
                        our page to be more concise and presentable. So we had to find a way to display only specific
                        information for each pokemon rather than the entirety of the raw data. Thankfully we were able to
                        do this by only grabbing specific parts of the stored data with things like "data.name", "data.height",
                        "data.weight", and "data.abilities" as well as grabbing the specific pokemon sprite from the data.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We are honestly really proud of how we did with this lab. As we weren't satisfied with displaying the
                        raw data as it was. We wanted to style it and make it look nice, so we picked out the specific data that
                        we wanted to display for each pokemon and even styled the pop-up in CSS to make it look pretty. We even
                        went as far as to add our favorite pokemon, Isabelle's being Eevee and mine being Blastoise. We also added
                        a button that would generate random pokemon data from the API for fun!</p>
