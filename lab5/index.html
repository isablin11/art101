			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with basic Javascript data types and variables. We also needed to
                        print out the make, model, color, year, and age of our car.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the major obstacles we faced was trying to figure out why
                        our Javascript wouldn't print the output on the main page. Our code
                        was exactly the same as the example but it wouldn't show the script output.
                        Of course we went back and found that we had messed up the document write command.
                        However we managed to correct it and get the script printed out.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went fairly smooth for us, as there wasn't a whole lot
                        of Javascript involved. Instead, we were more so experimenting with the
                        script output. We ran into some issues when it came to understanding the
                        java script terminology. However, we know that those are things we will come to
                        learn in time and during class. We used our previous knowledge of HTML and CSS to
                        structure the page neatly.</p>
