        <h1>Hello World</h1>

        <p>Hello, we are Isabelle and Sophie! I'm Isabelle and I am a 2nd year AGPM major planning to add FDM as a double major. I have no programming experience but I am looking forward to learn through this class and add coding into my skillset. In my free time I like to draw, cook, and play video games. I love cats and red pandas and I have a cat named Tabby! 
        <p>I'm Sophie and I am also a 2nd year AGPM major, planning to minor in FDM! The only programming experience I have is in Python from high school so I'm not too experienced. However, I hope to learn a lot about coding so that I can better communicate with programmers in the future when I'm in the game design industry. A few hobbies of mine are video games, creative writing, skiing, crochet, and reading manhwa. I have 3  cats back at home named Daisy, Dixie, and Olive but I hope to have my own cat one day as well!
