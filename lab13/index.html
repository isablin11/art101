					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lap was to experiment with loops.
                        We did this by creating a "FizzBuzz" function like we
                        experimented with in class. It cycles through numbers 1
                        to 200 and if any number is a multiple of 3, 5, 7, or 9
                        it would print out Fizz, Buzz, Boom, and Bang respectively.
                        Anytime a number was a multiple of several numbers, it would
                        print out these words together in the order they appear in the code.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems we ran into with this lab was actually getting the
                        code to output properly. Instructions were provided in the assignment, but
                        It was still a little confusing. Thankfully we were able to solve this by
                        tweaking the oneLongString variable to make it fit our JavaScript better.
                        And we used the same "output.html" as shown in the instructions. We then made
                        sure to call our function so that it would actually output.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We believe this lab went fairly well. It was a nice re-visit of the things we went
                        over in class. And allowed us to see a bit more closely how it was supposed to work.
                        We even decided to add the extra "Bang" element, where it would output on numbers that
                        were multiples of nine!</p>
