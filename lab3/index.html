			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Subject</h2>
					<p>Through Lab 3, we created a local file structure on our computers with new index.html files,
						then opened them in a live server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>When I was formatting the images on my webpage, the image keeps turning out to be too big and
						I had to scroll to see other parts of the image. At first I could not figure it out but my partner, Sophie, 
						found that we had "class" instead of "id," and changing it to the latter got the sizing to work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was unsure about how to do the links and bullet points at the bottom of the webpage at first, 
						so I had to consult my partner and compare our codes until I figured it out. It was definitely 
						a process but now I know how. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After Lab 2, I was able to explore a little more with HTML and CSS 
						since I am not as unfamiliar as last time. This led to more experimentation
						and trials & error, but it turned out pretty fun. Especially when the 
						images in my webpage turned out gigantic at first---that was pretty hilarious.
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here is the result. You are looking at it right now. Hope you enjoy!</p>
