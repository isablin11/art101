			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div id="challenge" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function that depended on conditionals.
                        In this case we added an input field that would take someone's name and sort them
                        into a certain bending type from Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems we ran into for this lab was getting the function to actually run
                        and output the house information after a user input their name. We came to find that
                        clicking submit did not do anything. As such, we debugged our code from there and found
                        that the sortingHat function had not been called correctly in our click handler for the
                        submit button. So we made sure to "let house = sortingHat" in order to correctly output
                        the house information.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall we are pleased with how this lab went. We had a lot of fun trying to decide
                        what houses/fandom we were going to use for sorting user inputs. We even added a short
                        description of each bending style after users are sorted. We ran into a few minor problems
                        but we were able to work through them all by looking at previous labs and our class notes.
                        We even included a font change to the output from within the JavaScript to make the text
                        stand out.</p>
