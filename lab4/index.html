					<h2>Making a Burger</h2>

						<li>Gather your ingredients and lay them on the counter</li>	
						<li>Toast your bread</li>
						<li>Add oil to the pan</li>
						<li>Lay the patty on a plate, lightly season with salt and pepper on both sides</li>
						<li>Once the oil heats up, put your patty into the pan</li>
						<li>Flip the patty once one side is cooked</li>
						<li>Fully cook the patty on both sides</li>	
						<li>Lay out the toasted bread on a plate</li>
						<li>Lay cheese on the patty, let it melt while doing the following steps</li>
						<li>Spread choice of dressing on the top bun (for example: ketchup, ranch, mayo)</li>
						<li>Lay lettuce on the bottom bun</li>
						<li>Lastly, lay the patty on the bottom bun</li>
						<li>Put the top bun on top of the patty</li>

					<h2>Simple Computer Game: Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Display game rules: Explain the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) to the player.</li>
						<li>Accept user input: Prompt the player to choose Rock (R), Paper (P), or Scissors (S).</li>
						<li>Validate user input: Ensure the input is valid (either R, P, S, or full words).</li>
						<li>Generate computer choice: Randomly select Rock, Paper, or Scissors for the AI opponent.</li>
						<li>Compare choices: Determine the winner based on RPS rules (Rock > Scissors, Scissors > Paper, Paper > Rock).</li>
						<li>Declare round result: Output whether the player won, lost, or tied.</li>

					  //print user input
					//generate computer choice
					  //print computer choice
					//compare user input and computer choice
					//check for tie condition
					  //tie if user input == computer choice
					//check player win conditions:
					  //rock vs scissors
					  //scissors vs paper
					  //paper vs rock
					//otherwise computer wins

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 4 involves pseudocoding an everyday task that most people do not know how to do and also pseudocode a simple computer game. We chose to do making a burger and playing rock, paper, scissors, respectively. These tasks are listed out in steps and high-level tasks and entered into HTML and later Javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had some difficulty entering the inputs for high-level tasks, as we couldn't just list all the steps to the game like how it would work in real life. We had to think about how the player is going to interact with the computer and how the computer is going to respond to player inputs. We fixed this by thinking in broader terms: for example entering R/P/S are generalized as “entering inputs,” and the computer recognizing which choice the player has picked is called “recognizing inputs.” Although it was confusing at first, we slowly got the grasp and completed the list of high-level tasks. The biggest issue that we encountered was indenting the subtasks within index.html; although the indents work fine when they are JS comments, it loses its indentation and becomes left aligned when the HTML is shown on live server. We eventually figured it out using an extensive list of CSS commands but resolved to just taking a screenshot in the js file and inserting that into the HTML.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went smoothly for us. In a way, this assignment is a simple introduction to Javascript where we were able to play with both the formatting of HTML and of JS. We worked efficiently as pairs and helped each other troubleshoot when one of us got stuck, switching on-and-off tasks and double checking the other's work. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The results are to our delight. You are looking at it right now! How to make a burger and how to play rock, paper, scissors with AI!</p>
