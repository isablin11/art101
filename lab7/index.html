			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we had to write a function that took user input and manipulated a string.
                        In this case we made it so a user is prompted to write in their name, the code takes that
                        input and basically mixes it up to create a "new name".</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't really run into any major problems for the main part of this lab.
                        We were able to follow the assignment closely and get the user input and everything
                        else working. There were some minor errors that came with simply typing out the
                        code we needed in JavaScript. But they were minor troubleshooting errors like mistyped
                        properties and missed semicolons.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We are very pleased with how this lab went. It went fairly smooth and the
                        end result was what was seen on the assignment example. It was satisfying to see
                        the pop up asking for the user input when we refreshed the page.</p>
