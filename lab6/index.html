			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we had to work with a partner while we
                        experimented with JavaScript arrays and Objects.
</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>As for problems we ran into, we found that during the First
                        task we weren't sure how to use console.log for printing
                        out all the elements of myMainRide. It would simply print out
                        something like [object, object]. But after looking into our notes
                        and the rest of the assignment we found the JSON.stringify print
                        out. Which allowed us to print all the aspects of the myMainRide object.
 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> We felt that this assignment went fairly well! Aside from some minor hiccups
                        that we were able to solve through simple debugging, the assignment went smoothly.
 </p>
