			<h1>Lab 11 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div id="challenge" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with JS events. In this case we needed to make an input
                        field where users can type their name and click a "submit button". Afterwhich a scrambled version of
                        their name is output/displayed.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We really didn't run into many problems with this lab. In fact, we completed it quite quickly. But after
                        completion we found that it only took the user input a singular time and would not send a new output without
                        refreshing the page. It would also return the same combination of letters every time. We wanted users to be able
                        to repeatedly click the button and produce a new combination each time. So we ran into issues with how to make that
                        work. We weren't sure how to get a new combination and output it every time the button was clicked. However, we
                        consulted Deepseek, a ChatGPT variant. And were able to find a function that worked as we needed.</p>

			<div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We are definitely happy with how this lab went. Especially since we decided to go ahead and include a function that
                        was not included in the assignment. We found something in the finished product that we wanted to improve and set
                        out and improved upon it. We did so after noticing on Professor Wes Modes' site that his button would generate a new
                        combination everytime. And we wanted ours to do the same. We were able to complete this little extra goal which
                        was very satisfying.</p>
